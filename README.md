# Universal app demo

### React-powered universal i.e. isomorphic app

With this project I will be trying some new things, especially relative to my work with my [current site](http://github.com/blwsk/blwsk). I'm going to use the same React components on both the client and the server. In other words, it'll be isomorphic. A babel polyfill will allow for jsx to be used for server rendering. For the client, webpack hot loading will be used to bundle the code.
